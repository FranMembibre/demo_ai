## Getting Started

To set up this MkDocs site locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check this by running `python --version` in your terminal.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the MkDocs Server**: Start the MkDocs server with the following command:
   ```
   mkdocs serve
   ```
   Your documentation site will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Creating Blog Posts

To create a new blog post, add a Markdown file in the `docs/blog/posts` directory following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Each post should include front matter for metadata such as title, date, and tags.

## Customizing the Site

You can customize the site by editing the `mkdocs.yml` file. This file contains various settings, including the site name, theme, and navigation structure.
